# clPredatorPrey

This repository contains the OpenCL code that runs the model describing spatial self-organisation in a predator-prey system, as published in:

Sherratt, J. A., X. Lambin, C. J. Thomas and T. N. Sherratt (2002). "Generation of periodic waves by landscape features in cyclic predator-prey systems." Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 269(1489): 327-334.

An video of the output of the model can be found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx9PRIb860k This video has been produced by the code in this repository.

The use of graphics processors for simulating ecological models (using CUDA) at large spatial scales is described in:

van de Koppel, J., R. Gupta and C. Vuik (2011). "Scaling-up spatially-explicit ecological models using graphics processors." Ecological Modelling 222(17): 3011-3019.

To run this model, read my "General-Instructions" repository.
